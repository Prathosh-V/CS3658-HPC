### GridSearchCV for Linear Regression with OpenMP Optimization
This C++ code implements GridSearchCV (Grid Search Cross-Validation) for linear regression and optimizes its performance using OpenMP, a widely used API for parallel programming in shared-memory systems.

### Introduction
GridSearchCV is a technique used for hyperparameter tuning, where the algorithm searches for the optimal combination of hyperparameters by exhaustively evaluating a grid of parameter values. This implementation focuses on tuning hyperparameters for linear regression models.

OpenMP is used to parallelize the computation, leveraging multiple CPU cores to improve performance. Parallelization is applied to critical sections of the code to accelerate computation, especially during the cross-validation process.
