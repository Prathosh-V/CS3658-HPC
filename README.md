### Linear Regression with OpenMP Optimization
This C++ code implements linear regression and optimizes its performance using OpenMP, a widely used API for parallel programming in shared-memory systems.

### Introduction
Linear regression is a fundamental technique in statistics and machine learning for modeling the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables. This implementation focuses on simple linear regression, where there is only one independent variable.

OpenMP is used to parallelize the computation, leveraging multiple CPU cores to improve performance. Parallelization is applied to critical sections of the code to accelerate computation, especially when dealing with large datasets.
